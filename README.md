  ## Description
  Budget Tracker was created to allow a user to track their budget.  The user can enter a name for the transaction, the transaction amount, then select whether to add or subtract the funds.  If internet connection is interrupted, the transactions are stored by the app and will be retrieved and displayed upon reconnection of internet service.  The transactions are logged in a list under the inputs, and also displacyed on a graph.
